# Save To Pocket Extension

## What is it?

Save to Pocket Extension is a web browser extension that provides Pocket users the ability to save content to their Pocket account. It does this through either a toolbar button or a context menu item that, when activated, send the page or selected link to the Pocket API.

Additionally, a small, injected pop-over in the upper right hand of the current page provides feedback indicating status of the save and allows the user to operate on the content they have just saved by adding tags, archiving the page, or removing it from their list.

The extension will also show the user additional recommendations of content based on the content they have just saved. The user can turn off these recommendations in the extension settings _(webkit only at this time)_

## Extension Architecture

> Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please. â€” Mark Twain

Here we aim to get down some facts about the Save to Pocket extension and its implementation details. We can demystify some of the finer points of extension development by breaking it down into more manageable pieces.

1. [Fundamentals](#fundamentals) - Talking about how we can more easily reason about extension development.
2. [Data Flow](#data-flow) - Outline how information flows around an extension.
3. [Pocket Implementation](./pocket-implementation.md) - Get into the details on Pocket specifics

### Fundamentals

#### Overview

Extensions are powerful and can do quite a bit using the same technology that is used to build web sites and web apps (HTML/Javascript/CSS). The primary difference is that extensions code runs in a few isolated contexts. We can think of these isolated contexts as layers of the extension. Each layer handles a different aspect of the extension.

- [Browser Layer](#browser-layer) - Actions added to the browser chrome _(toolbar, context menu)_
- [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) - Background process that runs separate from any individual page.
- [View Layer](#view-layer) - Content that operates inside the current page
- [Native Layer](#native-layer-safari-only) - (_Safari Only_) native app to manage the extension.

A typical website runs solely in the [View Layer](#view-layer); extensions add an additional [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) running in the background, and a [Browser Layer](#browser-layer) allowing the user to engage with the extension across any number of pages.

The [View Layer](#view-layer) is _isolated_ so may not invoke actions or directly affect other layers. It does have the ability to dispatch and receive messages to the extension later.

#### Browser Layer

These are actions that happen in the browser interface (not the page it's displaying). This layer is used to define the elements we are interested in adding to the browser. In our case, a toolbar button is defined along with a context item. Without additional connections, these elements have no inherent functionality and no business logic is defined in this layer. This layer is generally defined solely in a manifest file

- WebExtension API: _manifest.json_
- Safari: _info.plist_

There are methods that allow us to modify the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer) from the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) in order to react to a users action, but for now let's just think of this as defining entry points to the extension.

#### Extension Layer

This operates behind the scenes. This layer is in charge of API calls to the server, updates to and from the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer), and receiving/dispatching messages to the [View Layer](#view-layer). This layers entry point is represented by single file:

- WebExtension API: _background.js_
- Safari: _SafariExtensionHandler.swift_

This where the bulk of the business logic for the extension will take place. We setup a listener on this layer that will capture messages from the [View Layer](#view-layer) and [Browser Layer](#browser-layer). When a message is received, the correct corresponding action is taken and then it will potentially dispatch a success message back to the script or update the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer) directly.

This layer is common to all tabs/pages so it's the best place to store/retrieve data and respond to browser events such as opening new pages, switching tabs, etc.

#### View Layer

This is injected into the page and allows us to display UI and capture user actions from that UI. The actions captured here are dispatched to the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) via a specialized API provided by the browser. Other extensions might use the viewport instead of building UI in the page, which is more similar to how Firefox implements Save to Pocket.

#### Native Layer (Safari Only)

Safari adds an additional layer that contributes to distributing and installing the app. This [Native Layer](#native-layer-safari-only) is a native OSX app that could potential be a full fledged app, but for our purposes serves as an installer and settings handler\*.

\* _this functionality is forthcoming_

### Data Flow

#### Basic

The way data flows in an extension at its most basic is:

1. User take action in the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer). Ex: Clicking the toolbar button
2. The [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) registers the event occurred and dispatches a message to the [View Layer](#view-layer)
3. The [View Layer](#view-layer) receives the message and updates its UI
4. The [View Layer](#view-layer) exposes a further action the user can take (ex: adding tags to a saved item) that, when invoked, sends a message back to the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) with the relevant information.

![basic data flow diagram](./assets/basic-flow.png)

This basic pattern is the same in both Safari and the Web Extension API (chrome, opera, edge, etc.). The main difference between the two is the method of implementation. Web Extension API is completely Javacript where Safari requires the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) to be handled with a compiled language (such as Swift) so it may be distributed through the app store.

#### Pocket Specific

From here on out we will go through piece by piece and add them to our data flow diagram. After covering the general concepts, we will outline any differences in implementation between Safari and Web Extension API.

- [Browser Layer Details](#browser-layer-details)
- [Extension Layer Details](#extension-layer-details)
- [View Layer Details](#view-layer-details)
- [Native Layer Details](#native-layer-safari-only-details) - (_Safari Only_)

#### Browser Layer Details

##### Toolbar Icon

![expanded data flow diagram](./assets/expanded-flow-1.png)

When the user clicks on the toolbar icon the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer) receives a message that contains information about the page/tab that is focused.

> Web Extension API: A Javascript handler receives `tab` and `url` parameters

> Safari: A swift handler receive a `SFSafariPage` page and we extract the URL to save from it.

##### Context Menu (_right click menu_)

![expanded data flow diagram](./assets/expanded-flow-2.png)

When the user right clicks on something in the page the context menu appears. The extensions allow us to add an item to that context menu. When the user selects this added menu item we make a check whether they are clicking on a link or not. If it is a link, we save that link, otherwise we save the page the context menu was invoked on.

> Web Extension API: A Javascript handler receives `info` and `tab` parameters. We check if `info` contains a URL to determine if we are saving a link or the page itself. We then route to `saveUrlToPocket` or `savePageToPocket` respectively.

> Safari: In our injected script we set up a listener for `contextmenu` event. When handling that event, we check the `event.target.href` to determine if we are saving a link or the page itself. We then dispatch an action to the Safari App Extension with the relevant details, which routes to a `saveLink` or `savePage` respectively.

#### Extension Layer Details

![expanded data flow diagram](./assets/extension-layer-1.png)

This is where the ~~âœ¨Magic~~ bulk of the extension functionality is contained. The key to understanding this layer is to think of it as isolated from the other layers. This layer is a locked room and the only way to interact with it is to pass explicit messages back and forth between the other layers.

> **Note**: \_Since this layer operates in a completely different context from the page, developer tools will not show warning, errors, network requests, consoles, etc. that originate from this layer. In order to use developers tools here (in webkit browsers), you will need to open the extensions page ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)) and choose to inspect the `background page`

##### Receive

Listeners are set up on the [Extension Layer](#extension-layer-details) to recieve any messages dispatched from both the [View Layer](#view-layer-details) and the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer-details). While the [Browser Layer](#browser-layer-details) messages are generally narrow in their scope and sometimes have built in receivers, the [View Layer](#view-layer-details) can dispatch any custom message along with parameters.

The message handler we set up takes an identifier and parameters. We check the identifer and then invoke the corresponding function with the parameters (if any).

```javascript

function handleMessage(event) {
  const { message, name = 'Unknown Action' } = event || {}

  switch (name) {
    case "API_REQUEST_FOR_INFO": {
      const {data} = message
      return APICall.getInfo(data, callback)
    }

    default: {}
  }

```

##### Send

When we want to send messages back to the [View Layer](#view-layer-details), we dispatch a message via the browsers extension API. This message is caught by the listeners set up in the [View Layer](#view-layer-details)

> Web Extension API: `chrome.runtime.sendMessage(message, callback)`

> Safari: `page.dispatchMessageToScript(withName: name, userInfo: nil)`

#### View Layer Details

> Safari: `safari.extension.dispatchMessage(message, userInfo)`

```javascript

function handleMessage(event) {
  const { message, name = 'Unknown Action' } = event || {}

  switch (name) {
    case SAVE_TO_POCKET_SUCCESS: {
      // Update our UI to indicate a successful save
      return
    }

    default: {}
  }

```
